<h1>Invitation system with QR feature -ongoing</h1>

Saw a job post on Upwork

I'm looking to send invites to about 1000 people.
Invitees will follow the link, see the video.
At the end of the video, they can click to discover more or rsvp.
When they click rsvp, they will enter their info and get a qr code, so they can show it to the host the day of the event.
By scanning the qr code, the host will see the name of the person. Once scanned, invite is not valid anymore.
